## Integrations With Other Plugins

In PublishPress Future Pro it is possible to schedule changes to your posts based on metadata. This makes it possible to integrate PublishPress Future with other plugins.  For example, you can create a date field in the Advanced Custom Fields plugin and use that to control the date for Future Actions.

When you are using an integration, there are five types of data that you can update in PublishPress Future:

* Action Status: This field specifies if the action should be enabled.
* Action Date: This field stores the scheduled date for the action.
* Action Type: This field stores the type of action that will be executed.
* Taxonomy Name: The taxonomy name for being used when selecting terms.
* Taxonomy Terms: A list of term's IDs for being used by the action.

## Import the Future Actions

PublishPress Future Pro supports imports from external data sources. You can import posts and automatically create Future Actions associated with those posts.

The best approach is to use the Metadata Scheduling feature. If you're using a plugin such as WP All Import, you can match up the import tables with the fields you have selected in the Metadata Scheduling feature.

[Click here to see how to import data for Future Actions](https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/imports-and-metadata-scheduling/).

## Details on How Post Changes Works

For each expiration event, a custom cron job is scheduled. This can help reduce server overhead for busy sites. This plugin REQUIRES that WP-CRON is setup and functional on your webhost.  Some hosts do not support this, so please check and confirm if you run into issues using the plugin.

## Logs for All Your Post Changes

PublishPress Future Pro allows you to keep a detailed record of all the post updates. PublishPress Future records several key data points for all actions:

* The post that the action was performed on.
* Details of the post update.
* When the change was made to the post.
