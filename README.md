## How to install?

You can download a built package from [releases page](/releases/) and install it on your WordPress sites by uploading the zip file.

## How to build a package?

### Requirements

 - Docker

### Building from inside the dev-workspace

To enter the development workspace, run the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
dev-workspace/run
```

From inside the dev-workspace you can run the build or any other composer script. Check `composer help` for a list of available commands.

```bash
composer update
composer build
```

### Building JS scripts

```bash
composer build:js
```

### Building Language files

```bash
composer build:lang
```

### Building without entering the dev-workspace

```bash
dev-workspace/run composer build
```

## Testing

### Requirements

 - Docker
 - PHP
 - Composer

Tests will run inside docker containers, but all the commands below should be executed outside the dev-workspace.

### Starting the test containers

Before running any test you need to start the test container:

```bash
composer test:up
```

For stopping, you can use:

```bash
composer test:down
```
Test files will be cached inside the `dev-workspace/.cache` directory.

### Running all tests

Only Unit and Integration tests are healthy for now. You might find other types of tests but they need refactoring.

```bash
composer test:all
```

### Running Unit tests

```bash
composer test Unit
```

### Running Integration tests

```bash
composer test Integration
```

You also can run specific test file:

```bash
composer test tests/Unit/Framework/HooksTest.php
```

And for running only a specific test:

```bash
composer test tests/Unit/Framework/HooksTest.php:testAddAction
```

You can run any codeception command by executing:

```bash
composer codecept <commands>
```
